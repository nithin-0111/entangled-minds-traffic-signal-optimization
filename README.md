## Introduction
This project aims to design an intelligent traffic signal optimization algorithm that dynamically adjusts signal timings based on real-time traffic flow patterns, congestion levels, and time of day. The goal is to reduce wait times and improve overall traffic flow using machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
The project leverages reinforcement learning to optimize traffic route management and utilizes OpenCV for vehicle detection and density calculation. By simulating different traffic scenarios, the algorithm dynamically adjusts traffic signal timings to enhance traffic efficiency.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- Machine Learning (Reinforcement Learning)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- HTML/CSS/JavaScript (for frontend)

## Algorithm
1. **Data Collection**: Gather real-time traffic data using sensors and cameras.
2. **Vehicle Detection**: Use OpenCV to detect vehicles and calculate their density.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Implement reinforcement learning techniques to train the algorithm for optimal traffic signal timings based on various parameters such as:
   - Traffic flow patterns
   - Congestion levels
   - Time of day
4. **Simulation**: Create a simulation environment to test the algorithm's effectiveness in various traffic scenarios.
